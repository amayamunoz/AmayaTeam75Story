Mary was in love with penguins. However, she grew up her whole life on a little island where there were no penguins. 
She only ever got to see pictures, until one day...

She had a chance to travel with her friends to the south pole. She believed there must be a lot of penguins there, 
so she was very exited.   

When she got to the south pole Mary was incredibly disapointed. There were
some penguins but no Emporer Penguins! She didn't care about the tiny, boring ones, she wanted to see Emporers! She was so angry that she decided that she
no longer liked penguins. Seals would be her favorite animal because they huntedpenguins.
