Mary was in love with penguins. However, she grew up her whole life on a little island where there were no penguins. 
She only ever got to see pictures, until one day...

She had a chance to travel with her friends to the south pole. She believed there must be a lot of penguins there, 
so she was very exited.   

When she got to the south pole Mary was incredibly disapointed. There were
some penguins but no Emporer Penguins! She didn't care about the tiny, boring ones, she wanted to see Emporers! She was so angry that she decided that she
no longer liked penguins. Seals would be her favorite animal because they huntedpenguins.
 
So Mary went on her great excursion to find the best seals she could, quite like she did for penguins. She traveled all across
the South Pole, but she eventually got cold, so she swam back home, sad that she didn't find what she looked for.
On her way home, she picked her head up to see a strange park that she hadn't seen before. She walked in and
saw that it was a zoo! She all sorts of animals, from giraffes to zebras, but she didn't see the seals yet...

She asked a zoo worker, who told her they would be happy to lead her to where
the seals were. When she got to the top of the pool the seals were in, she was
in shock and fell over. The worker smiled. Mary blacked out for a moment,
and when she opened her eyes, she saw she had a seal flipper. She barked and
her dream had come true.
